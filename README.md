# PINK
Native Token of  Pink Power Coffee 
About $PINK, the PINK POWER COFFEE Token on The Open Network, is a unique utility token designed to bridge the digital and physical realms through a platform that supports sustainable coffee farming practices and women working in coffee fields. Our goal is to create programs to teach about TON blockchain and how to integrate it in their daily lives. The game is about teaching users about sustainable and organic coffee practices in Colombia and how this coffee is farmed and prepared for roasting.
